Starting point is the two-particle irreducible vertex in the two particle-hole channels which is approximated by the bare non-local Coulomb interaction and all local vertex corrections. From this we calculate the full non-local vertex and the non-local self-energy through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The AbinitioD{\$}\backslashGamma{\$}A approach naturally generates all local DMFT correlations and all non-local {\$}GW{\$} contributions, but also further non-local correlations beyond: mixed terms of the former two and non-local spin fluctuations. We apply this new methodology to the prototypical correlated metal SrVO{\$}{\_}3{\$}.},

abstract = {Strong electronic correlations pose one of the biggest challenges to solid state theory. We review recently developed methods that address this problem by starting with the local, eminently important correlations of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). On top of this, non-local correlations on all length scales are generated through Feynman diagrams, with a local two-particle vertex instead of the bare Coulomb interaction as a building block. With these diagrammatic extensions of DMFT long-range charge-, magnetic-, and superconducting fluctuations as well as (quantum) criticality can be addressed in strongly correlated electron systems. We provide an overview of the successes and results achieved---hitherto mainly for model Hamiltonians---and outline future prospects for realistic material calculations.},

@phdthesis{Rohringer2013,
abstract = {The central focus of this thesis is the theoretical description of non-local electronic correlations characterizing the physics of important classes of materials such as, for example, transition metal oxides or rare earth compounds. From the theoretical side, in the last two decades, a big step forward was achieved by the development of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which accounts, non-perturbatively, for a relevant part of the electronic correlations, namely the local ones. In that way, it was possible to theoretically understand several important effects arising in correlated materials, as the Mott metal-insulator transition. However, many fascinating phenomena such as, e.g., unconventional superconductivity or quantum criticality, originate from (or are at least strongly affected by) non-local correla- tions, which are not captured in the framework of DMFT. This thesis aims precisely at the development and the application of novel methods for including non-local electronic correla- tion effects at all length scales beyond DMFT. These extensions of DMFT are mostly based on the calculations of two-particle local vertex quantities. Specifically, the Dynamical Vertex Approximation (D$\Gamma$A) requires as input the local irreducible vertex ($\Gamma$) of DMFT, and we demonstrate its applicability by analyzing the anti-ferromagnetic phase-transition in the Hubbard model. Finally, a completely new method for considering non-local correlations, based on the generating functional for the one-particle irreducible vertex functions, is introduced. This novel approach, including a larger number of Feynman diagrams, might further improve over the D$\Gamma$A, and, in perspective, lead to a unifying theoretical description of the non-local electronic correlation effects beyond DMFT.},

@article{Rohringer2012,
abstract = {Electronic correlated systems are often well described by dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). While DMFT studies have mainly focused hitherto on one-particle properties, valuable information is also enclosed into local two-particle Green's functions and vertices. They represent the main ingredient to compute momentum-dependent response functions at the DMFT level and to treat non-local spatial correlations at all length scales by means of diagrammatic extensions of DMFT. The aim of this paper is to present a DMFT analysis of the local reducible and irreducible two-particle vertex functions for the Hubbard model in the context of an unified diagrammatic formalism. An interpretation of the observed frequency structures is also given in terms of perturbation theory, of the comparison with the atomic limit, and of the mapping onto the attractive Hubbard model.},

abstract = {We study the expansion of single-particle and two-particle imaginary-time Matsubara Green's functions of quantum impurity models in the basis of Legendre orthogonal polynomials. We discuss various applications within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) framework. The method provides a more compact representation of the Green's functions than standard Matsubara frequencies and therefore significantly reduces the memory-storage size of these quantities. Moreover, it can be used as an efficient noise filter for various physical quantities within the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solvers recently developed for DMFT and its extensions. In particular, we show how to use it for the computation of energies in the context of realistic DMFT calculations in combination with the local density approximation to the density functional theory (LDA+DMFT) and for the calculation of lattice susceptibilities from the local irreducible vertex function.},

@book{Mahan,
abstract = {The first, second, and third editions of this book seem to occur at ten year intervals. The intent is to keep the book up-to-date. Many-body theory is a field which continually evolves in time. Journals only publish new results, conferences only invite speakers to report new phenomena, and agencies only fund scientists to do new physics. Today's physics is old hat by tomorrow. Students want to learn new material, and textbooks must be modified to keep up with the times. The early chapters in this book teach the techniques of many-body theory. They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents. This scan recorded the words accurately and scrambled the equations into unintelligible form. So I retyped the equations using LaTeX. Although tedious, it allowed me to correct the infinite numbers of typographical errors in the previous edition. The earlier typesetting methods did not permit such corrections. The entire book was edited sentence-by sentence. Most old sections of the book were shortened by editing sentences and paragraphs.},
